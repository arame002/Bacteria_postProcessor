** Run bacteria_postProcessor.ipynb file for a sample file.
It clean up data of trajectories and plot trajectories and velocities.

1- Convert *.mov files to *.avi using "conver_movToAvi.sh"
2- Use Fiji
  a) Load *.avi files with Fiji
  b) Use TrackMate to detect trajectories
  c) Save Tracks data coming from edges
3- Convert the ouptup file compatible with the code by using "convert_from_edges.py"
4- plot trajectories and many histograms by using "bacteria_postProcessor.py"

Matlab files are being used for analyzing simulations. With some changes, "bacteria_postProcessor.py" can be used for analyzing simulations as well.
